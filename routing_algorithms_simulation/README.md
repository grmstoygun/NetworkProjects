Project 4 will be related with implementation of routing algorithms. The program will run both Link State and Distance Vector Routing algorithms. You are supposed to create a network topology randomly based on the number of nodes given as an input by the program user runtime. Once the topology has been created the program will generate source-destination routes using both Distance Vector and Link State Routing algorithms one by one. The routes generated will be illustrated at the screeen on the given network topoloty. The forwarding tables should also be shown for each node either step by step or eventually according to the algorithm chosen. Finally the output should include forwarding tables, packet transmission delay (end-to-end) , total cost of the path chosen, run time of the algorithm, number of hop counts (end-to-end).
