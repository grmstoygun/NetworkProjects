This project is about Socket Programming. In this project, you are supposed to write a client and server application and communicate them using socket programming. The client application will contact to the server application using TCP protocol and upload a text file including student name, student number, course name to the server. The server will keep this information in a file. After the connection closed, the client will make a second connection to the server and download this text file. Then the client will compare the file already existing at the host device and the one downloaded. If they are the same, it will generate a report indicating successfull transmission of the message. Otherwise it will generate an error report. 

 

The porject documents will include source files, a video demonstration of the program running and a document explaining the project together with the outcomes.
