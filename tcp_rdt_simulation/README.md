n this project you will design a graphics simulator for simulating TCP Protocol. The aim of the project is to simulate the working of reliable transport protocol starting from rdt1.0 to TCP according to the definition giving at the textbook. You will simulate rdt1.0, rdt2.0, rdt3.0 and TCP Protocols.

In this simulation you will divide the screen into four subsections. At the left upper corner, you will show Reliable Data Transfer Service Model as shown in Figure 3.8. At each step you will highlight the triggering function call. At the right upper corner, you will show corresponding state diagram action/events both for sender and receiver. At the left bottom corner, you will show operation sequence diagram of the message transfer as shown in Figure 3.16. Finally at the right bottom corner you will show command prompt to illustrate the commands and outputs of each command as should be shown at the screen.

You will run the simulation for at least one normal transaction, one premature ACK, and one lost, and one timeout events and illustrate the outcomes for all four cases as mentioned at the beginning.
