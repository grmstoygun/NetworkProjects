The aim of this project is to feel about internet infrastructure and the delay effects. 
For that purpose you will choose ten different destination based on their geographical distances from the source point. 
You will use traceroute program to measure the delays from source to destination. 
You will repeat the test at four different days and for each day at three different time. 
For each setup you are supposed to repeat the measurements for a number of times such as 10, 20, ..100 and calculate the max, min and average of those measurements. 

You are supposed to draw diagrams of delays againts of the three parameters by fixing two of them each time. 

Finally you will make your comments on the outcomes you will observe.
